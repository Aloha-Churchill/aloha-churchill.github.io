Hello üê£, and welcome to Strange Loops. You may have arrived here after clicking on a link, or maybe even a few. Let this site be a respite from the arduous journey of websurfing. On this site, you can find projects and blog posts that I have worked or collaborated on since around about September 2023. My hope is that some of the posts and/or projects could provide some inspiration for fellow hobbyist coders, encoders, or decoders. Enjoy, and have a groovy day!
