# the spin

For this project, I thought it would be interesting to create a YouTube video documenting the process to learn a bit about editing and more importantly garner fame and fortune from the 10s if not 100s of potential views. Perhaps with the money made from this video, I'd be able to buy a 1/1000 of a tube of toothpaste -- the possibilities are endless.

I think it would be fun to do another YouTube video in the future, and would be nice to make it more collaborative. Here's some improvements to be made in future videos...

* Aspect ratio correction
* Audio volume correction
* More showing simulation (code execution) than code implementation

These are only the beginning of improvements. Incorperating nice visuals or animations, improving video quality, and utilizing music in a more effective manner, etc. would also help to improve quality. However, like Rome, YouTube channels are not built in a day, and I daresay it will take a bunch of iterations to be satisfied with the quality.
