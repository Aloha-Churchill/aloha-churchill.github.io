# Orbit.js

## Initial Concept
For work, I was thinking about how to draw "backup lines" like you see in more modern car dashboards. The zone of the backup line should depend on the articulation angle of the wheels, since it needs to predict where your car is projected to be going. In order to understand what variables were needed to caluclate these "projection zones", and because of it's aesthetic appeal, I turned to write a small simulation in JavaScript, using the wonderful THREE.js library.
