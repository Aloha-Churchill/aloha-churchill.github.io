## Intro
Some notes on readings of "Democracy In America" (only the first chapter, if even that) and "John Adams" by David McCullough.

## Notes on Democracy In America 
* Equality of conditions is basis for american democracy
* France used to have feudal system which was solely based on force but then clergy opened up to all ranks of government
    * Somthing similiar thing happened in Barbara Tuchman’s A Distant Mirror where the widow of Raoul I at sold to Coucy in 1197 its charter of liberties as a free commune for 140 livres. However, Tuchman argues that this democratization was not in line for the continual human progress towards liberty, but rather more up to chance or the desperation of a nobel in trouble. 
* When societies fall into disarray they can become more democratic or more authoritarian. 
* Is the path toward liberty inevitable or by chance – these two historians have separate ways to see it. 
* Tocqueville says it is the most permanent tendency – but I’m not so sure about this. Roman society became relatively democratic but after fall middle ages were a mess. 
* People who are liberated to work generally are more mutual beneficial to a society (like slaves who were offered the opportunity to work to earn freedom were more productive and their masters benefited) BUT there are also top down concerns which oppress this continual liberation. 

## Notes on John Adams

David McCullough's John Adams was a wonderful read. Chronologically presented, it follows Adams from an ambitious youngster living in Braintree through his time as the second President of the United States to his death on July 4, 1826.   

Here are some of the ideas throughout John Adams that I wanted to write about in order to perhaps help me start to think about them a little more clearly. They are broken up roughly by ideas that pertain to John Adams as an individual and ideas that revolve around the history of the time period from the 1750s-1820s.

John Adams

The amorphous nature of leadership

Leadership takes on many different forms. Adam’s style of leadership necessarily changed with his various roles which was sometimes an uncomfortable transition. In his early life, John Adams had a small sphere of influence. In this period, he led primarily by friendship, earning respect from his peers through good conversation and his devotion to his studies. Indeed, Adams placed high importance on friendship throughout his life, calling it “one of the distinguishing glories of man.” As he started to practice law, his reputation continued to grow due to his professionalism and honesty. I was surprised to learn that John Adams himself served as the legal defense of the British soldiers in the Boston Massacre. He not only accepted the role unhesitatingly but defended the soldiers exceedingly well, acquitting nearly all of them. In his defense of the soldiers, Adams led by example with his devotion to justice. 

The Boston Massacre trial was a launching point for Adams’ political career.  His oratory skills made him a figure of prominence in the First Continental Congress. During his time serving on the Continental Congress and as a senior delegate to Europe, John Adams led by initiative and assertiveness. While Thomas Jefferson remained reserved and unconfrontational during his time in the Continental Congress and George Washington was described by Abigail Adams as having a “distant without haughtiness” quality, John Adams took a stance on nearly every issue and could be somewhat abrasive at times, although he demonstrated remarkable compassion and politeness towards his opponents for the most part.

Adam’s role as the first vice president of the U.S. marked a transition in his leadership. The newly defined vice presidential role was a passive position in comparison to John Adam’s past ventures. Instead of spearheading decisions in the senate, the vice president was to “preside” or “oversee” senatorial sessions. Adam’s felt that he was ill-suited for the role, initially embarrassing himself by creating controversy over small decisions like how to formally address the president. Instead of being the central orator, Adam’s role shifted to more of an informed onlooker. By and by, Adams adapted to the role though he felt at times that “To be wholly overlooked, and to know it, are intolerable.” He courageously took much of the flak directed at the administration, leaving Washington’s reputation relatively untainted. John Adams led in his role as VP by supporting the administration, remaining hard at work in the background, and casting decisive votes in tie-breaking decisions. 

As president, Adams again was cast into an authoritative role. However, instead of the more individualistic crusader that he had been on the Continental Congress and during his time in Europe, Adams now had to learn how to become an administrator and manage his own cabinet.

Though John Adams’ leadership changed throughout his life, his honesty, desire for information to make good decisions, and drive for goals rather than personal glory remained the most defining and important characteristics of his leadership.

Self-Awareness
John Adams was continually reflecting upon his thoughts and actions. As a young man, he started keeping a journal. In letters to Abigail, Jefferson, and Rush, Adams spoke his opinions and asked for advice. David David McCullough said in an interview that “Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That's why it's so hard." In a period where the written word was king (though John Adams would have preferred the word president ;)), John Adams showed an incredible aptitude for thinking clearly. His eloquence was probably partially a product of extensive daily writing and refining.  

A young John Adams wrote that “Reputation ought to be the perpetual subject of my thoughts and aim of my behavior”. I laughed a little when I first read this line, but in thinking more about the context, Adam’s goal to refine his reputation was one that made a lot of sense. Reputation sounds a bit superficial, but the traits like honesty, hard work, friendship, and open-mindedness that create a good reputation are anything but shallow. He critiqued himself for his vanity and saw this as a character defect that could compromise his reputation. 

It is a great joy to read about characters like Adams. McCullough is masterful at highlighting very admirable qualities of Adams among which are his extreme honesty, dedication to learning, sense of humor, and friendship.
Revolution
“What do we mean by the Revolution? The war? That was no part of the revolution; it was only an effect and consequence of it. The revolution was in the minds of the people.” - John Adams
Revolution as a movement

Power and scope of the government
Going from thinking that “Government is a plain simple intelligent thing founded in nature and reason: → 

Spirit of Rebellion vs Complex Practice of Rebellion
The publication of Thomas Paine’s pamphlet, Common Sense, caused a sensation throughout the nation, which is also a wonderful rhyme. Newspapers wrote that the mystery (at the time) author of this pamphlet was a genius. However, John Adams did not like Common Sense. He thought the arguments presented lacked thorough reasoning. It was inflammatory, rather than solution-seeking. While spirit and soul are necessary for inciting rebellion, unless incredible caution and thought are present, the rebellion becomes but a trivial flame.  

Thomas Paine’s common sense was a national sensation, but John Adams did not like it (pg 96-97). To be writing
