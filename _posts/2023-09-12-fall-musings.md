* The Dutch had a stronghold in the spice trade in Southeast Asia. A young Brit saw an opportunity for the British to compete in this lucrative marketplace.
* The East India Tea Company invented the idea of lobbying
* 16 and above were not allowed to join the EIT.
* Clive
* Dual
* Factions
* The Americas and their relationship with the EIT. Boston Tea Party
* Opium grown
* A great famine happened
* Common bonds
* Division by missionariesv

I have heard that people are more unwilling to click a  on. How "on topic" should a blog post be. Should it just be about one thing? Multiple?
* Reading a book is like sipping on a glass of hot water wheras watching a youtube video is more like drinking room temperature. Even though you might be just as hydrated in the end, there's a certain care adn pace which books seem to flow at.
