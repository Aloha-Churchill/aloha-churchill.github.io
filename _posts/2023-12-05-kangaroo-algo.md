## introduction

Today, I thought it would be fun to click 4 random links starting from the Wikipedia page on [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) and try to learn about or just comprehend what the topic ended up being. In the spirit of Markov, to do this, I generated 4 random numbers from 1 to the number of link elements on each page and was delighted to end up on a page titled [Pollard's kangaroo algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_kangaroo_algorithm).
