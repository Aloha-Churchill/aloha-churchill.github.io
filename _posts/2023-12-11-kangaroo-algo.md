## introduction

Today, I thought it would be fun to click 4 random links starting from the Wikipedia page on [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) and try to learn about or just comprehend what the topic ended up being. In the spirit of Markov, to do this, I generated 4 random numbers from 1 to the number of link elements on each page and was delighted to end up on a page titled [Pollard's kangaroo algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_kangaroo_algorithm). POllard's kangaroo algorithm is a way to solve the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) which is given as follows:

Find \\x \in Z_n s.t. \alpha^x = \beta\\ where *G* is a finite cyclic group of order *n* which is generated by the element \\ \alpha\\. 

## initial look at kangaroo algorithm ðŸ¦˜

Looking at the steps to the algorithm was puzzling. 

```
1. Choose set of integers to check for a solution in
2. Define a pseudorandom function mapping elements of the chosen group to the group G from the discrete log problem.
3. choose an integer N and compute first sequence of group elements. 
x_0 = alpha^b
x_{i+1} = x_i * alpha^(f(xi))
```

Already, this was flummoxing. While it makes sense that we are computing powers of alpha, why this pseudorandom generation function of a seemingly arbitrary set? Well, let's just continue on and see if it makes more sense...

```
4. d = sum from i=0 to N-1 of f(x_i). This means x_N = x_0 * alpha^d = alpha^(b+d)
```

Still not sure about these steps, but we'll turn to the second half of the algorithm.

```
5. A second sequence is computed, with y_0 = beta. Each element is y_{i+1} = y_i * alpha^(f(y_i))
6. d is ocmputed in the same manner as the sum from i=0 to n-1 of f(y_i) such that y_i = beta*alpha^(d_i).
```

Now, for the final step

```
The algorithm terminates either if there is
1. Collision: if y_j = x_N for some j, then x = b+d-d_j and the DLP is solved
2. Exceeding bound: if d > b-a + d, algorithm failed. Change S or f
```

## circling back
Nearly always I find the hardest question to answer is not how something works but *why* it works*. However, the *why* is hard to answer without the how so the initial legwork is not for nothing. So why do these steps help to solve the DLP? 

Let's take an example and explain what each step is actually doing.

**Example:** 
Let us have a group $G$ of order $n$ generated by $\alpha$. We want to find the $x$ such that $\alpha ^ x = \beta \mod n$.


1. Choosing a set $S$ and defining a map $f$

Let's say we want to search for a solution in the range of $[a,b] = [0,100]$

Let $S = \{1,2,4,8,16,32,64\}$. This way, the average of the set is roughly $10 \approx \sqrt{b-a}$. We choose this set so that the leap cover the interval efficiently.

Finally, for this first step, let's define a function $f$ which will map numbers from $G$ to $S$. The pseudorandomness helps avoid predictable patterns that could miss the logarithm.

2. The tame kangaroo: computing the first sequence $\{x_i\}$

Let's now use this information to compute a sequence of length $N$. We will start with $x_0 = \alpha^b \alpha^100$. The pseudorandom function $f$ then determines the size of each jump. The sequence is generated as follows...

$x_1 = x_0 \cdot \alpha^{f(x_0)}$ 

$x_2 = x_1 \cdot \alpha^{f(x_1)} = \alpha^b \cdot \alpha^{f(x0) + f(x1)}$

...

$x_N = \alpha^b \cdot \alpha^d$ where $d = \sum_0^{N-1} f(x_i)$

Here, $d$ can be thought of as the total "jumping distance" in this sequence. Essentially, we're exponentially jumping through the group in a random way starting from the highest number.

3. The wild kangaroo: computing the second sequence $\{y_i\}$

Now, we repeat the process above but start from a different place: $y_0 = \beta$

This time, instead of just keeping track of the total distance, we'll keep track of the cumulative sum of jumping distances at each step $d_i$.


4. Collision: solution to the DLP
When $y_j = x_n$ for some $j$, this means a collision between the "two kangaroos hopping around the group" has been found. Since $x_N = \alpha^{b+d}$ and $y_j = \beta \cdot \alpha^{d_j}$, we can equate these two and dividing by the $\alpha$ term in both sides we have that $x = b+d-d_j$ and the DLP has been solved.
