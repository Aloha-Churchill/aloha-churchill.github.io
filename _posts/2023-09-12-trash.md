# Garbage Disposal
My mind has been in the gutter...thoughts about the garbage and recycling system have been swirling around in there for a few months now, and so I thought it would be nice to clean up my mind by dumping these thoughts out. A warning in advance for the number of garbage related words and trashy puns that will be used in this post.  


# Inspiration: Order without Design

"Order withought Design: How Markets Shape Cities" is an excellent podcast (based off of a book with the same title) about how emergent order and central planning (usually done by a government organization) shape a city. I was listening to this podcast earlier this year, and have included some notes related to the "disposal and sanitation" topic from this podcast. I'd highly recommend listening to this podcast, as there is a ton more detail and interesting discussions about a wide array of topics in urban planning and development. 

## Notes and thoughts
- Depopulating cities are problematic. 
    - A lower density of people means a higher price to pay per individual to support shared facilities and services.
    - Garbage disposal is such an example. 
    - It seems that there is a sort of undulating curve for cost per indivdual of public resources. Here's a thought experiment considering the number of garbage trucks to service an area. If every new 1,000 people who move into an area need 1 more garbage truck, then when there are 1,999 people, all of these people split the cost of 1 garbage truck vs 2,000 split the cost of two. But, let's say the number of people keep increasing and the garbage routes become more efficient and trucks cheaper because the city purchases more. Then, the overall cost per person goes down. I'd imagine the cost per individual of paying for public goods might mimic the following image (note that this is not based on any research, just a passing thought).
     ++ TODO INSERT GRAPH THINGY

- Private organizations such as Disneyland are inscentivized to keep their campus clean because they can capture the profit of cleanliness (i.e. more tourists will come to Disneyland if it is cleaner)
    - Municipalities do not caputre this profit, and so might be less willing to put in the money or time to keep an area clean...I think municipalities actually do capture this profit, but it's less direct. In general, it seems like when the source of cash is not obvious, it can make groups upset.

- Disneyland has pneumatic trash system called an AVAC.
    - Pneumatic (like hydraulics but with compressed air) linear actuator is used to control flow of waste. Then, waste is sucked by a vacuum to a compactor.
    - Other cities have this type of disposal system including Stockholm, Barcelona, and Roosevelt Island in New York.

- The WHO (World Health Organization) came to Yemen to increase the water supply. An unintended effect of this effort was that because there was now more water and sewage around the city, the clay ground was saturated, destabilizing the foundations of existing buildings in the area.

- How do city planners or officials engender good hygine habits?
    - A laissez-faire method would be to rely on more affluent pockets to adopt modern techniques of hygeine. These techniques can spread throughout the rest of society by becoming cheaper due to innovations in the practice *or*  because the more affluent benefit from the entire community adopting good hygine practices by the "herd immunity" effect, and thus spread the practice to as many people as possible. 

- The Black Plague killed roughly 40 percent of the population
    - Interestingly, cities grew in size after Black Plague. One theory is that because of the labor shortage, people from the countryside had an inscentive for the first time to move to the city to earn a higher wage.
    - Endemic refers to a reoccurring disease in an area, wheras an epidemic is a high increase in disease in a particular region. 

## Goals
Urban development and design is a field, and like any field it seems rather fruitless to investigate everything all at once. Therefore, I wanted to narrow my scope to a smaller topic: disposal and sanitation. Of course, even just within the area of "sanitation an disposal in urban design" there is too much to unpack, probably even in a lifetime but at least it was a starting point to focus on. I was planning on traveling alone for a few weeks, and thought it would be nice to have a few investigative questions, so I wasn't completely aimless.

* Is sanitation driven by culture or government. 
* How do different countries or cities garbage management systems work. What about recycling?


## Bin there, dump that
- Copenhagen
    - Deposit & return system. Pay a deposit when you purchase drinks and such in cans/bottles and you can get this deposit back by returning them emptied. This is not unique to Denmark. 
    - On the Copenhagen waste management page: "the backbone of the waste managment system in Copenhagen is source separation"
    - Aims to recycle 70% of municipal waste by 2024
    - Big chains like 7-11 (which interestingly, seems to be much more popular here than I've seen in the states) give out wooden utensils and paper products. One problem I noticed at KÃ¸benhavn H tran station was that even with these compostable materials, there was a lack of compost bins in the immediate area, and I saw a large stack of compostable cultery in the trash.

- Barcelona
    - Combination of pneumatic collection and manual bag collection
    - Felt similar to New York City in terms of cleanliness.
    - Very small garbage truck size, which was typical of many of the cities in Europe.
    -  Ajuntament (city council) of Barcelona describes trash as the "remains of products no longer wanted" which sounds like something you'd read in a novel about ghosts.
    - 5/10 
- Singapore
    - Unique trash management system. Burns trash and then filters smoke. The combustion process is also used to drive turbines ot produce electric energy. There is a landfill island called Semakau, that is made from deposits of ash. This island can sustain wildlife.
    - 9/10   
- Colorado
    - Seems like a typical US trash collection system. In the place where I live, we have a trash bin, recycling bin, and compost bin. You can pay to increase the size of your trashbin. 
    - Western disposal, which is a private company picks up the cans. However, there are also public landfills. It seems like the private and public sectors work together to handle both waste collection and processing.
    - 7/10
- Amsterdam
    - Sidewalk bins that feed into underground trash containers
    - RFID chip readers in some neighborhoods to eliminate unwanted dumping
    - Waste management is covered by municipal service tax. [This paper](https://www.epsu.org/sites/default/files/article/files/2012_Waste_mngt_EWC.pdf) says that private and public waste collection was evenly split as of 2012. What I don't understand about this is the fact that even though there is a tax for waste, people may still be opting for private trash disposal?

## Garbage entropy
Waste managment is a complicated process. Here's how I have broken it down.

* **Sorting**: The trend from reading about and visiting these places seems to be in sorting waste as much as possible. 
* **Processing**:
Especially in public parks 

# Reduce, reuse, recycle

## E Waste
* Apple's Daisy recycles lots of components
* 


"If in doubt, throw it out" while no doubt catchy, is it correct. As recycling facilities become more advanced.

And there's a reason that recycle is third in the "reduce, reuse, recycle" saying. Recycling certainly takes up the most resources of the three. 
What is worth recycling
Pyramid of recycling intensity

Robotic innovations

Some friends and I were able to tour a robotics company that developed robotic. 

Scalability and durability are the name of the game in recycling robotics (unlike precise and reliable in the world of say, medical robotics).
